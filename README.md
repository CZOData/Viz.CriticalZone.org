# Viz.CriticalZone.org
This repositiory is for bug and issue tracking and for the CZO Data Visualization Portal at http://viz.criticalzone.org/.

The CZO Data Visualization Portal provides visualization and access to data from the ten Critical Zone Observatories (http://criticalzone.org/national/infrastructure/observatories-1national/). It is one components of the National CZO Program's online data discovery and access mechanism, together with the National CZO Program web site (http://criticalzone.org/) and the CZO Search Portal (http://search.criticalzone.org/).

This website is an instance of the Vizer data explorer application created by Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS).  Please note that this repository does not contain the actual code for the application.

Funding for Critical Zone Observatories and the CZO Data Visualization Portal has been provided by the US National Science Foundation (NSF).
